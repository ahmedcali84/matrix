## Installation

To compile and run the matrix operations program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ahmedcali84/matrix.git
    cd matrix
    ```

## Usage

The program performs various matrix operations. You can specify the maximum value for matrix elements using a command-line argument. Here is how you use the program:

1. **Compile the Program**:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

2. **Run the Program with Command-Line Arguments**:
    ```bash
    ./main <max-value>
    ```

   - `<max value>`: This argument specifies the maximum value that each matrix element can take. For example, if you run `./main 10  `, the program will generate matrices with values ranging from 0 to 9.

3. **Example Usage**:
    ```bash
    ./main 10 
    ```
